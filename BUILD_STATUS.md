# v0.4.0 implementation and release status

Local implementation and independent review are complete for a limited public-source release candidate. GitHub publication is authorized; the release page records the published artifact and live CI results. MIT was selected for original material; the intended public repository is imMamdouhaboammar/chatgpt-ads.

## Knowledge and skills

The current registries contain 68 source records, 60 claims and 5 conflict records across 13 coverage areas. The September 11 refresh added nine scoped claims through a hash-bound transaction, preserving prior registry history. The twelve skill entrypoints retain shared knowledge and runtime-specific instructions.

The update addresses automatic creative controls, explicit spending authority, possibly stateful draft flows, reporting-versus-edit templates, fractional native metrics, timezone identity and attribution-label uncertainty. Source-backed facts and external account observations remain separate. No real export, account API call, tracking transmission or live campaign action was performed.

## OS and runtime boundaries

Linux and macOS (Darwin) are verified guarded-workflow execution targets, passing all 69 core tests with descriptor-backed no-follow traversal and Darwin system alias normalization. Native Windows guarded workflows are unavailable in this release: the doctor reports the unsupported capability explicitly rather than silently weakening path protection. See [Windows boundary](docs/WINDOWS.md). Hosted native Windows restriction checks and doctor passed on Python 3.11 and 3.14.

Earlier v0.2.1 Codex and Claude keyboard localhost browser simulations remain historical evidence for those exact inputs. They do not validate the changed v0.3.0/v0.4.0 implementation. Fresh advisory runs are synthetic; the [probe assessment](acceptance/v030/probe-assessment.json) records successes and remaining errors.

## Release acceptance

The preserved test records show Linux and macOS Python 3.11 and 3.14 each passing 69 core tests, 12 analyzer tests, five workflow cases, ten offline measurement cases, doctor, source-folder retrieval and package validation. Twelve skill entrypoints pass static validation. The independent review passes for the limited local scope with no unresolved blocking findings. The final archive is verified after this report is frozen; its checksum and extraction results accompany the ZIP outside the source tree. Do not interpret the MIT license or this prepared repository target as evidence of publication or live account readiness.

The public source projection and ZIP exclude raw account evidence, private workspace data, rollback copies and legacy scaffolding. Source manifests use hashes for integrity, not authentication or signatures. File guards and agent instructions are not isolation against another process with equal access.

Remaining native gates are described in the [live acceptance handoff](docs/LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md). A clearly limited community release can proceed without paid campaign testing; native integrations remain disabled until their own evidence requirements are met.

## Universal multi-agent distribution update (v0.4.0)

v0.4.0 establishes full multi-agent ecosystem packaging:
- OpenAI Codex Plugin support with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `CODEX.md`.
- Claude Code and Claude Desktop Marketplace support with `marketplace.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Skills.sh registry compatibility via `.skills.json`.
- Universal executable installer via `install.sh` and Bun/npm CLI entrypoint `bin/cli.js`.
- AI discoverability metadata via `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`.
- Verified macOS (Darwin) POSIX safe I/O support.
Current CI results are linked from the README badge. Dated acceptance/v030 records describe their original evidence scope. The supplied cover and workflow image are illustrative artwork, not an observed account screenshot.
